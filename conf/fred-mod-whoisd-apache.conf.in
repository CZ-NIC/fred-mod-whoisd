# The default configuration file for mod_whoisd apache module.
# See mod_whoisd's documentation for description of configuration directives.
# Include this file in main httpd.conf configuration file or copy the content
# of this file to httpd.conf.
#

#
# The most preferred way of configuration is to put whois in virtual host.
# This way you can continue to run http in normal way and besides that, if
# somebody connects to port @PORT@ on @NSHOST@, whoisd protocol will be activated
# for that connection.
#

# Whois port, assigned by IANA
Listen @PORT@

#LoadModule corba_module modules/mod_corba.so
LoadModule whoisd_module modules/mod_whoisd.so

<VirtualHost *:@PORT@>
   # mod_corba's configuration, you have to have installed mod_corba module
   CorbaEnable       On
